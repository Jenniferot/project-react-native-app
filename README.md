# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I built a "Quarantine activity generator" using React Native. It generates suggestions on activities from an array that I came up with. It's a multiscreen app using React Navigation.

## The problem

I started making a sketch on how it would look on the screen, how many screens that would be included and which components I would make. Next step was to create the array of activities that the app would generate activities from. 

I used React Navigation, a Lottie animation and I downloaded a font.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
